# Association tests

Null model: y = Ca + V

- y: quantitative phenotype; Nx1 vector
- C: covariates such as PCs, age, sex; NxP matrix
- a: effects of covariates; Px1 vector
- V: variance-covariance matrix of y estimated beforehand; NxN matrix

Alternative model: y = Ca + xb + V

- x: genotypes of a SNP to be tested for association; Nx1 vector
- b: effect of SNP; scalar
